This a school projects which I did with my team, and I am proud to share it with you all.

This game is developed using JAVA. 
The main idead of this game, is that you can build a park, where after that you can start the simulation where guests come in and use games, or go in restaurants.

My main tasks in this game were:
  - The UML class diagram development
  - GameEngine class development, which includes:
      - Menu interaction with the user
      - Dragging buildings around the grid
      - Simulation process
  - Breadth-first-search algorithm implementation for path finding for guests to a certain building
